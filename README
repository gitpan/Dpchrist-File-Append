NAME
    Dpchrist::File::Append - append to file or filehandle

DESCRIPTION
    This documentation describes module revision $Revision: 1.32 $.

    This is alpha test level software and may change or disappear at any
    time.

  SUBROUTINES
   fappend
        fappend FILEHANDLE, LIST
        fappend FILENAME, LIST

    If first argument is a filehandle or a string beginning with '*', writes
    LIST to specified FILEHANDLE via print() and returns true. Whether the
    file is clobbered or appended is determined by how the caller opened the
    filehandle.

    Otherwise, assumes first argument is a file name, appends LIST to file
    via File::Slurp::write_file() and returns true.

    LIST is optional in either case, but fappend() will write to filehandle
    or append to file regardless, creating the file if it did not exist.

    Calls Carp::confess() on error.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

    All of the subroutines may be imported by using the ':all' tag:

        use Dpchrist::File::Append          qw( :all );

    See 'perldoc Export' for everything in between.
